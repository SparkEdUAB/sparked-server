This is an initial graph representation of sparked-server
![graph representation ](gr-updated.png)
The above graph is initial and doesn't contain all data, this is likely to be updated.

The following are examples of data of GraphQL queries and mutations

### Authentication

All the queries need to be authenticated, you can authenticate via a login mutation
**Register**

```graphql
mutation {
  register(email: "olivier@gmail.com", password: "oL7vi3#") {
    email
    password
  }
}
```

The password is hashed and never stored as plain text, the above mutation will return the email and a hashed password.

**Login**

```graphql
mutation {
  login(email: "olivier@gmail.com", password: "oL7vi3#")
}
```

The above mutation will give you results that include a token like this

```json
{
  "data": {
    "login": "eyJhbGciOIkpXVCJ9.eyJ19pZCI6MzM2MDd9.trf9Rm-4w9nFBl4_gF1DfSTH2__xo"
  }
}
```

You can then use the login token to pass it in headers as "authorization" to authentication any of the queries and mutations below

**Adding a course**

```graphql
mutation {
  addCourse(name: "Introduction") {
    name
  }
}
```

**Querying courses**

```graphql
{
  query {
    getCourses {
      _id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
